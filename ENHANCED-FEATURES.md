# JSON2Table - Complete Inline Expansion Features

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
The JSON2Table Chrome extension now features advanced expandable functionality for both arrays AND objects, displaying nested data as proper sub-tables with column headers. This provides a seamless way to browse complex JSON data like product reviews, user profiles, settings objects, and other nested collections without ever needing popup modals.

## âœ¨ New Features

### 1. **Table-Style Array Expansion**
- Arrays expand into proper sub-tables with dedicated column headers
- Each array item becomes a table row with clearly defined columns
- Professional table styling with alternating row colors and hover effects

### 2. **Inline Object Expansion** ðŸ†•
- Objects now expand directly in the table as property-value tables
- Three-column layout: Property | Value | Type
- No more modal popups - everything accessible by scrolling
- Smart value formatting for dates, booleans, numbers, and nested structures

### 3. **Smart Column Detection**
- Automatically detects column structure from array objects
- Prioritizes important fields (id, name, title, rating, comment, date, price, description)
- Samples up to 50 items for comprehensive column detection
- Limits display to 10 most relevant columns for optimal viewing

### 4. **Enhanced Value Formatting**
- **Dates**: Automatically formats ISO dates to readable format (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM)
- **Booleans**: Shows âœ“ for true and âœ— for false with color coding
- **Numbers**: Displays integers and decimals appropriately
- **Null/Undefined**: Shows "-" with italic styling
- **Nested Objects/Arrays**: Shows summary info (e.g., "[3 items]", "{5 props}")
- **Long Text**: Truncates with ellipsis and shows full text on hover

### 5. **Individual Collapse Controls**
- Each expanded array has its own "Collapse" button
- Each expanded object has its own "Collapse" button
- Maintains the global "Expand All" and "Collapse All" functionality
- Visual feedback with button hover effects

### 6. **Optimized Performance**
- Dynamic height calculation for virtual scrolling with expanded arrays and objects
- Efficient rendering cache that handles complex nested structures
- Smooth scrolling even with multiple expanded elements

### 7. **Enhanced Search**
- Search functionality works across all expanded content (arrays AND objects)
- Can find text within nested object properties, array items, etc.
- Fast JSON.stringify-based search with optimized performance

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Basic Array Expansion
1. Load any test page with product/user data
2. Look for purple array badges: `[+] [2] items`
3. Click to expand and see individual items as table rows
4. Notice proper column headers (rating, comment, date, reviewerName, etc.)

### Object Expansion ðŸ†•
1. Look for blue object badges: `[+] {4} properties`
2. Click to expand object properties inline
3. See three-column table: Property | Value | Type
4. Notice formatted values (dates, booleans, etc.)

### Expand All Functionality
1. Click "Expand All" button
2. All arrays AND objects in the dataset will expand simultaneously
3. Scroll through the table to see all expanded data
4. Search for specific terms across all expanded content

### Mixed Data Navigation
1. Expand both arrays and objects for the same record
2. See complex nested data displayed in organized tables
3. Use individual collapse buttons to manage specific expansions
4. Navigate through user profiles, settings, addresses, purchases, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure Support

The enhanced expansion works with various data structures:

### Object Arrays (Primary Use Case)
```json
"reviews": [
  {
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Excellent product!",
    "date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "reviewerName": "John Doe",
    "reviewerEmail": "john@email.com"
  }
]
```

### Nested Objects ðŸ†•
```json
"profile": {
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "age": 32,
  "verified": true,
  "lastLogin": "2025-07-06T09:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Mixed Nested Structures
```json
"user": {
  "id": 1,
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "age": 32,
    "verified": true
  },
  "addresses": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Simple Arrays
```json
"tags": ["electronics", "audio", "wireless"]
```
